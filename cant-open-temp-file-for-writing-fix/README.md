# Download redirect: can't open temp file for writing FIX

> [!CAUTION]
> For other projects (not [STALKER-RP.NET](https://stalker-rp.net)) use the Python script, or install [STALKER-RP.NET Launcher](https://files.stalker-rp.net/installer.exe) and launch PowerShell script.

_**SA-MP cannot find the folder to save the cache of model files. Most likely, this happened due to your intervention in the cache path (changing settings in the multiplayer client) or the client cannot gain read access to the folder.**_

> [!NOTE]
> To launch, open the console (PowerShell) using the key combination `Win + R` (or `Shift + right-click` on a folder) and enter `cmd`. Next, run the command `./cant-open-temp-file-for-writing-fix.ps1`
